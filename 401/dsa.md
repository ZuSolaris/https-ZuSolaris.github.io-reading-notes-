# Data Structures and Algorithims

**What is 1 or the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?**

We should always approach problems and data in way that not only allows us to be efficent, but also in a way that makes it convient for engineers to access data without the hassle of memorization or repettive code. This is where Data Structures and Algorithims come in.

**How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?**

In my experience using a conditional or a return or even making the code break if a requirement is not met.
