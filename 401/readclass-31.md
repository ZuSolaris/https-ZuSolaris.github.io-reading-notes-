# Reading: Context API



# What can React Context provide your app?

React Context can provide global data for an app. Such as language, theme, or a type of user.

## Why might we use Context?

Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

## Why should we use it sparingly?

Due to the fact that it makes component reusage much more difficult.
