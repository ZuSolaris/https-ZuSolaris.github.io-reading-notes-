## NodeJS

https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/

**How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?**

Node is basically an enviroment meaning its a place where many different things are occuring. Think of it like an aquarium, it is a complex live enviroment where many 'enviromental' factors are occuring. It is event based... meaning that you can trigger and click on things to make certain actions to start, like you can drop food in a tank to get fish to react. Because it is asynchronous it doesn't have the requirement to wait for other 'clicks' or actions before it starts again. Asynchronous basically means these things or actions you have don't have to wait to start because they function on their own.

**What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?**

It means that the program will execute Javascript in the background as it is handling and executing the given code.

**What is Node used for?**

Used make a more efficent process of developing a modern JavaScript application.

## Additional Questions

**Looking ahead at this moduleâ€™s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?**

I'm really looking forward to the focus on career prep in this module. It looks like they are called workshops? I am also looking forward to the whiteboard interviews as well. I hope I can become somewhat job ready for the next steps of my programming journey. I'm wondering how this 2 part module dynamic will also be like, since this is the longest class I have taken in the pipeline.


**What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?**

I have one main learning goal and since it looks like code challenges are here to stay, in conjunction with a Udemy course I got, I would like to be speedy at code challenges which will help with the workshops as well. I've struggled with them since 301, but I have made a great amount of progress since then. 

A secondary goal is to somewhat be reliable with ReactJS and Redux without needing much help to get through problems it seems like this course is going to be the most intense yet so I'm ready for it.
