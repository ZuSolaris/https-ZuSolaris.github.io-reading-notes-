# Terminal Practice

**The Command Line:** is a text based interfaced system as opposed to a graphic user interface. You use commands and typing to navigate. To get to a terminal it comes with MacOS, Linux usually comes with built terminal as well, Windows there are many options such as Ubuntu, GitBash, and Putty. 

**Navigation:** pwd allows you to view what directory you are currently in, ls the gives a readout of all the items in that directory. You can then use cd to change directory and a .. to back out if you need to go back, that is described as a relative path while an absolute path consists of actually writing out the path.

**More About Files:** There are different basic file types such as executables (.exe), text files (.txt), and images (png, jpg, and even .svg), terminals are case sensitive and will not assume what you typed is what you are looking for and it even considers spaces to be part of the name. Quotes are used to use pick a specific item, and a  '\' will nullify meaning of the next characters. There is also a command to hide and find hidden files accessing it done by using '-a'.

**Manual Pages:** Typing in man plus the command you are search for is perfect for learning how a command thoroughly functions and you might learn a little more as well. Using man -k with the term you have will also give you results to all pages including it. Using n within a manual page will switch to the next found item.

**File Manipulation:** Mkdir creates the directories on the terminal, while rmdir does the opposite and removes the mentioned directory. If you are looking for a file it does not exist it will then create the file. cp stands for copying a file after providing the path and source file. To move a file you use mv which will then shift the file. rm removes the file you want are targeting, this one is dangerous because if youa aren't specific it can delete more than you want. 

**Summary:** I did not really have any aha, moments aside from learning about the manual pages, like that is such a useful tool for future reference. I also pinned the cheat sheet in my bookmarks super useful. But I did observe that I am, very comfortable with navigation and file manipulation through experience.
