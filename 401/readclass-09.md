Read today’s Lab Requirements

Note: Requirement is to spend one lab session working on this project, however additional time may be an option. Due date will be given in class and we’ll present briefly at the beginning of the next module.


## Discuss 2 possible project ideas that could be completed by you and a partner in the alloted time.

-Shoe Store managment hierarchy : Managers, Employees, and Customers

Seeing if theres any way to break someone's system and gain access to roles using the incorrect role.
