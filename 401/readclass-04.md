## NoSQL vs SQL

### What type of database is the best fit for the complex query intensive environment?

SQL database are the a good fit for complex query intensive enviroment.

### What type of database is the best fit for hierarchical data storage?

NoSQL Databases are much more well suited, for heirarchical data storage. This is due to the NoSQL database having a key value pair method and graph method.  



### Describe the differences in scalability between a SQl and NoSQL database as though you were speaking to a non-technical friend.

Think of SQLs like a table (like a physical table), while a Non SQL, can be expanded by adding more tables (physically) to put items on.


## SQL Modeling Techniques

### Among data tables, what is a one-to-many relationship and how do we “relate” them?

We relate to them using the following. 

-Table
-Field
-Primary Key
-Compound Key
-Foreign Key
-One to Many Relationship
-One to One Relationship

### Prior to designing your relational database, it might be useful to ___ a ___ of the database tables and their relationships.

Make a diagram and workflows of the databases to ensure you know what you want to build.


### Explain the difference between a primary and foreign key.

A primary key is used to ensure data in the specific column is unique. A foreign key is a column or group of columns in a relational database table that provides a link between data in two tables.

## SQL vs No SQL

### How do we treat keywords and parameters differently in SQL syntax?
In SQL an keyword can hold single data value of a specific type, while a parameter is an object that can exchange data between functions.

### Define normalization within the context of schemas and data.

This is the procedure of organizing data in a database and includes creating tables and establishing relationships between tables. 


### Explain the difference between one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships to a non-technical recruiter.

One to one: Think of it as an red crayon and a box, you have a red crayon and it goes to one specific box full of red crayons.

One to many: Think of it as the crayon has to be stored in a specific kind of box, but we also want to make sure the crayons are part of that specified amount.

Many to many: This means that the red crayon can go into many other types of boxes like a 12 color - 64 color, but it also means all the boxes can also distribute this red crayon.

### Reflection

I want to be able to adequately complete my SQL work as if it were that learning prep work.
