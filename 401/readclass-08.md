According to wikipedia these are the following rules.

Role assignment: A subject can exercise a permission only if the subject has selected or been assigned a role.

Role authorization: A subject's active role must be authorized for the subject. With rule 1 above, this rule ensures that users can take on only roles for which they are authorized.

Permission authorization: A subject can exercise a permission only if the permission is authorized for the subject's active role. With rules 1 and 2, this rule ensures that users can exercise only permissions for which they are authorized.


### Describe RBAC to a non-technical friend.

Role based access control is essentially the same concept between an employee and a manager, a manager has the ability to write schedules and fire and hire people, while an employee can only do certain tasks like only their role for example!
