# Readings: Authentication


## Readings

## Securing Passwords

Source: https://thehackernews.com/2014/04/securing-passwords-with-bcrypt-hashing.html

### Explain to a non-technical friend how you would safely hash and store a password.

Think of storing a password like change, we know the value of it and if organized we can understand it. But throw it in a jar and it will take a while to decipher to organize and find out its value. But if you use an algorithim is like using a change counter that you can just throw a bunch in and it will give you value.

### What is Bcrypt?

Bcrypt is an adaptive hash function based on the Blowfish symmetric block cipher cryptographic algorithm and introduces a work factor (also known as security factor), which allows you to determine how expensive the hash function will be.

### Why might you use something like Bcrypt?

Bcrypt minimalizes the possibility of a brute force attack by adding an additional layer of security and changes over a certain timespan making it resitant to brute force attacks.

## Basic Auth

### What is Basic Authentication?
Basic Auth is a simple technique used for enforcing, access contorls to web resources, doesn't require addotional
### What properties are necessary in the header of a Basic Auth request?

Authorization: Credentials which consist of the unique ID and password.

### How are username:password in Basic Auth encoded?

It is endocded using a BASE64 combination of an ID and password.


## OWASP auth cheatsheet

### Define the authentication process to a non-technical recruiter.

The authencation starts when someone requests access to a specific instance of an account. It is authenticated when the servers pass back and forth information to verify if it a user. It's as if you were checking someones ID, and asking the person simulateonously information about where they live and and other identifiers.

### How should your error messaging respond (both HTTP and HTML)? Why?

These are common errors to ensure user maximum security even with the least savy users.

-The user ID or password was incorrect.

-The account does not exist.

-The account is locked or disabled.

## Additional Questions

### Looking ahead at this moduleâ€™s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?

I'm looking forward to see how linked list do infact help us understand the application of authentication.


### What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

My learning goal is to essentially be comfortable with linked lists and authentication. I do not feel comfortable with either.
