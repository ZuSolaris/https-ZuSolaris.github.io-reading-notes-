Source 1: https://web.dev/learn/css/flexbox/

**Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.**

The Flexbox is an adaptable layout model. It takes content from one box and figures out the best way to return them in an organized fashion. This model is spatially aware and will adapt according so. 

**Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.**

The main axis is where the content moves together as a group!
The cross axis runs in the direction perpendicular to the cross axis!

**How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?**

Properties that reorder visual display away from how HTML is ordered can seriously impact accessibility.
Row reverse and column reverse will change it visually but not how it is structed in the HTML file itself, causing an issue for those who use screen readers!

**What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?**

Float was originally made to implent a layout to get an image within an column of text this made it easy to implement text wrapping and images. Float began to see usage in many websites allowing content manipulation in ways differed from the actual HTML source! This way however was much more complex!

Flexbox provides the following advantages: 

* Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.

* Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available.

* Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content.



**How does this topic connect with your long term goals?**
Flexbox is a reliable, compatable tool that creates layouts in an efficent and organized manner no matter the enviroment. 

Its a perfect analogy for my future I guess. No matter where I go I will present myself in an efficent and organized manner overcoming compabitability issues. Reaching my main goals as a successful software dev one day will take alot of the traits that Flexbox has by nature.
