# Class 02 Readings Notes

## Choosing a text editor!





## *The Command Line*

So this resource provides a break down of how commands works. 

-It begins by explaining inputs, outputs, and lines designations.

-It starts with a **user@bash** which is the current user accessing the terminal

-Then it proceeds to elaborate various inputs and outputs that can be used to have a result!

Here are a few examples!
pwd print working directory = You are here directory

**ls** list = list shows a comparison of all the directories

**cd** = change directory, lets you navigate file paths

*Tip*: typing the first letter and hitting TAB will auto complete

**Code** .= open VS code

**Cd .** =  level change = amount of dots +1\

**mkdir** = Create a folder
-These are just a few examples to name a few and not neccesarily included into the reading but are good for reference!

-The resource ends with the result which is what happens after you input a command!

## Basic Navigation 

So basic navigation is an overview on how to navigate the command line interface!

It begins with elaborating on **PWD** which is print working directory! Which tells you which directory you are currently in!

Then it brings up LS which is list which allows you to see what is located in your current directory!

It then segways into absolute and relative directories

Absolute Directories are defined either by whether they start with a ~ which is the root or a / which is related to a root directory

And relative directories do not begin with these designations but are rather navigated throughout the course!

## More About Files!

Terminals are  case sensitive it can't distinguish the difference between File.txt and FIle.TxT it takes it to the most literal sense.

Spaces are used to seperate between files and commands and a file will never have spaces in them! 

Quotes give specific files a designation that they can fit under and \ can be used to break these designations!

Hidden files can be made with an a. and -a can be used to reveal these directories!
