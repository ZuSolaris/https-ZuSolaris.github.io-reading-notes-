## *The Command Line*

So this resource provides a break down of how commands works. 

-It begins by explaining inputs, outputs, and lines designations.

-It starts with a **user@bash** which is the current user accessing the terminal

-Then it proceeds to elaborate various inputs and outputs that can be used to have a result!

Here are a few examples!
pwd print working directory = You are here directory

**ls** list = list shows a comparison of all the directories

**cd** = change directory, lets you navigate file paths

*Tip*: typing the first letter and hitting TAB will auto complete

**Code** .= open VS code

**Cd .** =  level change = amount of dots +1\

**mkdir** = Create a folder
