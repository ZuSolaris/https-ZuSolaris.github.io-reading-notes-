# Class 02 Readings Notes


## *The Command Line*

So this resource provides a break down of how commands works. 

-It begins by explaining inputs, outputs, and lines designations.

-It starts with a **user@bash** which is the current user accessing the terminal

-Then it proceeds to elaborate various inputs and outputs that can be used to have a result!

Here are a few examples!
pwd print working directory = You are here directory

**ls** list = list shows a comparison of all the directories

**cd** = change directory, lets you navigate file paths

*Tip*: typing the first letter and hitting TAB will auto complete

**Code** .= open VS code

**Cd .** =  level change = amount of dots +1\

**mkdir** = Create a folder
-These are just a few examples to name a few and not neccesarily included into the reading but are good for reference!

-The resource ends with the result which is what happens after you input a command!

## Basic Navigation 

So basic navigation is an overview on how to navigate the command line interface!

It begins with elaborating on PWD which is print working directory! Which tells you which directory you are currently in!
