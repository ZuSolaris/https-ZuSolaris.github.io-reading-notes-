## **Consider the history: That Time When Women Stopped Coding**

**What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?**

Computers were marketed as a masculine activity in the past and there was a real push in cultural aspects that influenced people to believe that it was a 'boy' field. Many boys grew up with computers in their home. This created an access and knowledge gap between genders.

**Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?**

They had access to tools earlier in life that weren't the cultural norm for other genders.

## **Ask the question: Why diversity matters to your tech company**



**When are diversity efforts most successful?**

When they are driven by a commitment from company leaders!

**Why do diverse companies perform better?**

They don't miss out on talent from these under represented backgrounds. They have better connections with more of their user base.


**Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.**

There naturally comes a cultural connection for example if there is some LGBTQ+ representation in a company, the features and cultural outreach becomes much more diverse and improved overtime. Its not just the LGBTQ+ community but also from ethnic and racial representation as well.
